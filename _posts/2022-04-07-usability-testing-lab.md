**Usability Testing Lab Write-Up**

**Task 1:** Thriving, Not Just Surviving in School
**Task 2:** Accessing the Resources of the High School

We believe our design is the best possible combination of our original designs because it takes the most important and useful aspects from each, and brings them together into a comprehensive idea of how we want our final app to look. We chose Thrive, Not Survive as one of our tasks because it highlights one of the central goals of our app – to help high school figure out how to succeed in school, but also help them to maintain a healthy lifestyle. From our contextual inquiries, we know that school often impedes students' happiness and not knowing the best ways to have success at Horace Mann can make school even more difficult. Accessing the Resources of the High School is our second task because it relates to helping students succeed in school. This task does not just relate to school experience, however, since de stressing about school can significantly improve students' mental and physical health. Succeeding in school and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are not mutually exclusive, and in fact, doing one will help students do the other. 
On the top of our design, we have labeled links that can bring people between pages of our app. This design is best suited to the people we are designing for because our users, namely high school students, will prioritize easy use of the app. This website design, with different pages dedicated to different topics, will allow students to easily find whatever resource they want, and the home page will help students figure out what information clicking on each of those subpages will give them. This convenience, along with the ability to easily find which pages will provide which information, makes our design best suited to those we are designing. 
	We chose these two tasks because they are most central to the idea of fostering community engagement and to helping the high school community. To foster community engagement, we feel that it is important to not just have a good experience at school, but also to help students maintain a healthy lifestyle. To do this, we have chosen to focus on the tasks that most directly address those two facets of our goal, school experience and lifestyle. Thrive, Not Survive is focused on a healthy lifestyle, though it does incorporate information about how to maintain this lifestyle with school in mind, while Accessing the Resources of the High School focuses on succeeding at school, but also has information about health and wellbeing-related resources in the high school, like the Guidance and Counseling Office, for example.

**Usability Test 1: Sally**
	This first test was conducted with a freshman, Sally, who is new to the school this year. This kind of user would be someone that wouldn’t already know a lot about the school, so our website would be helpful. Since only one of us could be there for conducting the test, they took a voice recording and notes. Sally was able to navigate almost all of the pages well, and was only confused about one thing. When creating a new discussion post, she was confused about whether to click the pencil icon, or click the create button. Our intention was for the user to click the button, so we decided to remove it for the next test. However, due to the logistical difficulties of group members going to DORR, we weren’t able to get the papers for the discussion page to the next member, so the second Usability Test doesn’t include the discussion page, but the third does.

**Usability Test 2: Bob**
	We conducted this test with Bob, a junior boy, in the middle of the library. This made sense as an environment because this seemed like a reasonable context in which someone would be using our website. It is important to note that Bob and I are friends and surrounded by other friends, which, along with the general environment of the library, made our surroundings somewhat distracting, possibly impacting the test. Only one person was there to conduct the test, so what we did was took a video of what happened during the test and then typed up exactly what Bob did and Bob's comments afterwards. So that one person took very brief notes on the test while actually conducting the test, then wrote up more details later. 

**Usability Test 3: Joe**

We conducted this test with Joe, a freshman boy, in our App Dev classroom. This made sense because it was a normal environment in which Joe was comfortable providing feedback in. Two people were present during the usability test: One was conducting the interview and the other was taking notes on the comments that Joe made during the test, both pros and cons of our design. Drawing from the negative incidents that were reported in usability test #1 and usability test #2, we edited our prototype in order to receive the most accurate feedback so that it is not repetitive. Some of these revisions included adding new icons, changing the design of buttons, making clear indications that will tell the user what certain buttons do and where they take you, etc. We conducted the usability test by giving Joe the prototype and asking him to find and do things with the website. During this usability test, the positive highlight was that he thought that our website was neat and organized, making it easy to navigate the site. A negative highlight was that although he correctly navigated the sit, he was hesitant about where to go. In the future, we will further upgrade our site so that it is even easier to navigate and there are clear indicators as to where the user should go and what they need to click in order to get to the page they want to go to. 

**Overall List of Incidents:**

Positive incidents:

*A positive incident from this first usability test was the way in which Bob navigated around the pages of the website. He understood how to move around the website perfectly clearly without our telling him anything besides to go around the website and read different pages.  (medium severity)
* Were able to figure out what was a button and what wasn’t (medium severity)

Negative incidents:
* A negative incident was the problem with the Discussion Page. The user didn't exactly understand clicking on the links on the left side to open up that stream of discussion on the right side. basically, the identifiers for clicking on the discussion sub-tabs on the left were unclear, and we will change this in future usability tests. This incident was not extremely severe, and though Bob had some trouble, we can make changes to make clearer how to read the discussion subtabs.  
* Seemed to hesitate when using the gray boxes to navigate (medium severity) - added “... more” at the end of the mini-posts
* 2 of the 3 were unable to navigate the discussion page easily (1 of them used a slightly different sheet though) (major severity) - got rid of the pencil icon in
