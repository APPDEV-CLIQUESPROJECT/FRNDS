Our group, FRIENDS, wants to use GitHub as a medium to code and design our final project. Our idea, which focuses on providing different types of resources and information to students, makes the most sense as a website designed primarily for computers. This is for two reasons. First of all, we can pack in more information on a computer website than a phone screen without decreasing the quality of how our app looks to users. Second, all Horace Mann students have computers, making for easy access to our website. Because a computer website makes more sense in terms of design, we can provide a better user experience, and since putting our website on a computer doesn't decrease the availability of our design to users, we believe that makes the most sense, which means using HTML. On our website, we want to incorporate aspects of different coding languages, namely CSS and JavaScript. Incorporating CSS will allow us to create a website that looks professional and Java will help us improve the usability of our website. The text stack that allows us to best do this is GitHub, as it allows for easy use of HTML as well as the incorporation of these other languages into our final product.
