**Edited Task Review**

Using our affinity diagram and the observations we made during our contextual inquiries, we came up with six tasks that our potential users should be/are doing that relate to our topic: integrating ninth graders into the HM high school community. All tasks are ones that students do to some extent, but we would seek to better accomplish these tasks for more people through our app. The tasks range in difficulty for our app to accomplish depending on time, comfortability, and frequency. Accordingly, they are labeled as easy, medium, or hard, or possibly somewhere between two of those levels. 

Task 1: Make new friends **(Hard)**

Student life revolves around friend groups, whether students hang out with friends during frees, lunch, classes, and more. Having friends, especially a good friend group, means that you establish at least a friendly dynamic with a group of people, which can help you meet new people, navigate classes, and support you emotionally. Students coming into the high school, both new and old, have to navigate the new social life, whether it be adjusting to the friend group changes that result from new students coming into the school or just trying to make new friends and find people who have similar interests to you. 
This can be a source of anxiety for incoming high schoolers, and this fear can make it more difficult for students to make friends. 

For example, we noted in our FOTW (and subsequent interview) with an incoming freshman that people will often worry about making friends, and have trouble breaking into a friend group. The task our app would be trying to accomplish is to help new high school students to navigate the first weeks of high school as they make new friends, possibly lose old ones, and deal with these large changes. We would provide them with advice or help about how to deal with the social chaos of the new environment. We labeled this task hard because it is quite difficult to get people to make friends, especially through technology. We noted in two of our interviews, both with a student and a teacher from Guidance and Counseling, that friend groups tend to be quite stable. For this reason, based on our observations from our contextual inquiries and interviews, we labeled this task hard. 

Task 2: Learn more about and utilize the resources offered in the high school **(Medium)**

When students come into the high school, they are generally unaware of the resources the school offers. In the middle school, there is an MD Reading Room, and a homework center, and at other middle schools there are likely similar offerings. 

Students will often assume that the resources offered by the high school are associated with places, like the resource of the library. However, there are many more resources that are less publicized than, for example, the homework center in the Middle Division, but are equally important. We have a similar homework help program in the high school, though it is never really mentioned at grade meetings or by teachers, like it is in the MD. Furthermore, the people in Guidance and Counseling, as well as those that work in the library, can be helpful resources for classes as well as to discuss emotional and mental health that can be negatively impacted by the transition into high school. In our contextual inquiry, we learned that most people that visit Guidance and Counseling were upperclassmen, suggesting that ninth graders didn’t know much about this department. The task of our app would be to better inform new students about these resources offered by the school and how to access them, something that will be difficult as there can be a stigma surrounding asking for help.

Task 3: Join extracurriculars **(Easy-Medium)**

At Horace Mann, we make it very easy to join extracurriculars. There are dozens of clubs, almost all of which are willing to accept anyone that joins. However, many students that are new to HM, or even just new to the Upper Division, don't understand why it is important to join clubs, sports teams, or other extracurriculars. 

Not only are there benefits like furthering your interests, but it is the opportunity to meet like-minded people that have similar interests. The task that we would be trying to accomplish is to encourage students that are new to HM to join extracurriculars. This task is deceptively difficult: the school already encourages students to join extracurriculars, and promote it with the Clubs Fair, and yet many students still don't choose to follow this advice. We noted in our interviews with both incoming freshmen and older students, that neither had really taken the chance to join a club. In our guidance and counseling interview, they pointed out that extracurriculars are a great way to get to know new people, and obviously have benefits in helping students develop their interests. It is really important for incoming high school students to join clubs, but they often will ignore the advice of teachers and advisors and won't join anywhere near as many as they will join by the end of their high school career. When designing our app, we should try to better understand why these students don't follow the advice given by the school and teachers, and how we can push them in the right direction. 

Task 4: Get adjusted to their classes **(Medium-Hard)**

When students come into the high school, the classes and expectations are completely different than they were in the Horace Mann Middle Division or likely were at other middle schools. It can be difficult for students to adjust to this, especially as they try to simultaneously navigate their academic and extracurricular experiences. 

A key difference between the middle and high school classes is the workload, which can often be unmanageable for students not used to such crazy amounts of work. Students must learn to develop a healthy lifestyle, getting all their work done and focusing on grades while still maintaining a healthy life outside of school and classes. The task of our app will be to help students get adjusted to the changing classes of the high school. This task is difficult given the differences between high school classes and middle school classes, whether those middle school classes were at Horace Mann or not. It can help students get adjusted to the school if they meet with their teachers, which our design could help them do or show them why it is so important. This task also means giving them useful advice to help them find this balance, as well as helping them manage their work schedules and study for tests. 

Task 5: Meet with their teachers **(Easy-Medium**

Teachers often have expectations for students to meet with them no matter how they are doing in their classes, but ninth graders aren’t always aware of this. When a student is struggling, they often know to talk with the teacher, but teachers can appreciate when students check-in without getting a bad grade first. 

It is important to develop relationships with teachers, so that students trust that teacher and become more comfortable going to meet with that teacher if they are having trouble with the class. It can also be intimidating for ninth graders to email their students and request meetings with teachers, especially if its the beginning of the year and they don’t know their teachers very well. This task is easy for students to do – it is as simple as going up to a teacher or sending them an email asking to meet, or even easier, just going in during office hours. But we called this task not easy, but easy-medium, because students can be hesistant about going to meet with teachers. So our task, which will be to help students get to better know their teachers, and encourage them to set up meetings, is easy-medium. 
 
Task 6: Create healthy sleep and eating habits **(Medium-Hard)**

It is a well-known fact that Horace Mann students will often sacrifice a healthy lifestyle to get work done. With the heavy tax of hard classes, extracurriculars, friends, and taking some time to relax, many students will often get far too little sleep. The CDC says that teens between the age of 13 and 18 should get between 8 and 10 hours of sleep, while many people that we know will often get as little as 4-5 hours a night. 

For new students trying to balance the extreme obligations of high school, as well as getting adjusted to high school life, they will often develop sleep habits that are much worse than those they had in middle school. Furthermore, it isn’t uncommon for students to skip lunch to get work done – one thing we noted in our FOTW was that students in Lutnick would often sit on their laptops for the whole period and would also often leave full sandwiches or other large chunks of food there. We saw students sacrificing their mental and physical health for the sake of schoolwork, choosing to not eat to get work done. That being said, creating healthy sleep and eating habits is more difficult than it sounds. They aren't called habits without reason, as they can be quite difficult to break. We want to encourage students to break bad habits, and provide them with tips and resources to do so, but we can't make the change for them, and that is what makes this a medium-hard task. Essentially, our app would have the task of encouraging students, but especially students new to the high school, to develop solid habits that will last not just throughout high school, but their lifetime.

**Now onto the Design...**

Design 1:

![design1](https://github.com/APPDEV-CLIQUESPROJECT/FRNDS.github.io/blob/5033c21f0227abcff57f11dde1670ad0843b4785/assets/img/2022-02-16%2013-18%201.pdf)

This design is a website that will teach new and old students about the high school, faculty, tips and advice, and much more. 

In order to do so, this website involves many interactive pages such as blog posts on healthy habits (How to balance work and sleep, healthy eating habits, etc), how to make friends, faculty guides, resources the high school has to offer (Guidance and Counseling, the Writing Center, the Math center, the Library, etc), and much more. This allows for new students to settle in easier and faster into the school, and efficiently and easily introduces resources in the high school that will benefit both old and new students for their success in the high school, and gain insight on information and habits that will help them in the future as well. 

Another feature this website will have is moderated public chat forums where students can ask questions which moderators or upperclassmen can then answer. (Note: These forums will follow Horace Mann Community Values and Norms with a no toleration policy for anything against them). Public forums promote community engagement and because they will be anonymous, students who may have trouble asking questions will be able to do so in a free and caring environment. 

The tasks that this design accomplishes are: 

Learn More About and Utilize Resources Offered in the High School - To help students learn more about the resources offered in the high school, we have grouped them under different tabs. For example, students can click on the tab called "Access Databases," and it will provide them with a link to the HM Library database webpage. 

Join Extracurriculars - We provide information about why joining extracurriculars is so important in the form of videos from former students. Also, we show types of extracurriculars, and under each of those tabs, will likely have a list with descriptions for each.

Make new friends - Forums allow for students to remain anonymous if they choose, however, they can say their name if they so choose, and can make new friends who have the same questions and interests!

Get Adjusted to Classes, Make New Friends, Develop Healthy Sleep and Eating Habits - These are all different tasks, but we have grouped them together because we are presenting information about them in similar ways. We have experts testify about the best way to get adjusted to classes, to sleep and eat healthily, and to make friends. We also give an example of a resource we could provide regarding this issue, in this case, how to schedule a meeting with Guidance and Counseling under the "make friends at HM" section.

Design 2:

This design is another webpage or app that has tips on how to succeed at Horace Mann. The idea of our app is to help Horace Mann Students have a better high school experience with a focus on community engagement, whether that be amongst students, between students and teachers, or any other groups of people at Horace Mann. 

Something we learned from our contextual interview with a new student and with the Guidance and Counseling people is that students are given tons of information when they come into Horace Mann about how to have success in high school. This can come in the form of HMO classes, things that advisors are told to tell their advisees, or just tips that students get from deans, teachers, or other adults. 

This design aims to provide students with many resources in one place. This has tips about extracurriculars, meeting with teachers, as well as an expert panel on some school related issues.  

In general, this design hopes to foster a more successful high school environment by improving the mental and physical health and academic and social lives of students. 

Below, we will describe the specific tasks that this design accomplishes:

Utilize Resources Offered in the High School - To help students learn more about the resources offered in the high school, we have grouped them under different tabs. For example, students can click on the tab called "Access Databases," and it will provide them with a link to the HM Library database webpage. 

Join Extracurriculars - We provide information about why joining extracurriculars is so important in the form of videos from former students. Also, we show types of extracurriculars, and under each of those tabs, will likely have a list with descriptions for each.

Meet with Teachers - We show students the benefits of meeting with teachers in the form of testimony from an upperclassman, and tell them when to schedule a meeting, how to ask for a meeting, how to act, and when teachers are available. 

Get Adjusted to Classes - We have experts testify about the best way to get adjusted to classes, and we can use the information from our contextual inquiry to help students settle in as easily as possible. We also give an example of a resource we could provide regarding this issue, in this case, how to schedule a meeting with Guidance and Counseling under the "make friends at HM" section.

Design 3:

![design3](https://github.com/APPDEV-CLIQUESPROJECT/FRNDS.github.io/blob/205e73371239cf55d0eddd2592826bceb642a562/assets/img/IMG_0686.jpeg)

This last design will be like a website with links to different sections based on what exactly the user is there for. It will include lots of colors to make it more exciting and less like a boring lecture on how to be a better student. 

There is a section for resources offered by the school (in bright green), an updated list of all the extracurriculars with information about them and how (if possible) to join them (in pink), a student-moderated discussion forum for underclassmen to ask questions from upperclassmen (orange), a page on tips with how and when to meet with teachers (purple), and a page with multiple interviews from experts on healthy habits and sleep (black). 

This will accomplish the following tasks:

Learn More About and Utilize Resources Offered in the High School - Many students, especially ninth graders, don’t know about all of the different resources, like Guidance and Counseling, the library, etc. Under this section, there would be a description about each of the resources, the people (faculty) involved, their location, and how to best utilize them.

Join Extracurriculars - Similar to the list sent out during clubs fair, this would be a page dedicated to all of the different extracurriculars available at HM. From sports teams, to clubs, to service learning opportunities, there are many ways the community can get involved with each other. Along with their description, each extracurricular’s faculty members, student leaders, important email addresses, and any promotional videos they want us to include. 

Meet with Teachers - Meeting with teachers can be scary at any age, so we would provide a page of tips and tricks on how to make the meeting go well. We would include what you should expect, how to prepare, email etiquette, and when the right time to go is. 

Get Adjusted to Classes, Make New Friends - The Discussion Forum would be moderated by one of us, with all posts and replies needing to be authorized before going public. This way, we could ensure all discussions remain within our community’s guidelines and are respectful of each other. The goal would be to help each other learn from others’ experiences and mistakes, while fostering connections between people of multiple grades.

Develop Healthy Sleep and Eating Habits - Our expert interviews would be conducted at least once a month with either a faculty member or someone in the field. All previous interviews would also be available, so that people can view them at any time. Questions for future interviews can also be posted, so students can get specific questions answered.
