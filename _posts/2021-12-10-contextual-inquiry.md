For the Contextual Inquiry, I conducted an interview with a freshman who came to Horace Mann in 6th grade, and who I don't know that well. For this purpose, let's call them Unicorn. The interview was conducted in the library during lunch time, meaning that it was slightly loud and there was lots of people there, and it was not formal so that Unicorn would provide the most realistic answers to help with this Contextual Inquiry. The only instruction I gave Unicorn was to provide the most accurate answers they could, and to act like this was not an interview to achieve that purpose. 

From the interview, I learnt that Unicorn had an established group of friends that, for the most part, did not change. Some other people would join them for lunch, but they weren't considered a part of the group since they didn't come regularly. I posed a hypothetical scenario if someone wanted to join Unicorn's group, and they said that friendships change over time, so it is possible that someone could join the group, but the original people in the group would not change. As well as that, from Unicorn's response, they said that ethnicity and topics of interest definitely play a role in the formation of friend groups. The friends in her group are all of one ethnicity, and they generally enjoy the same topics + share the same views on different subjects. In addition, she said that the level of difficulty in forming or joining a friend group depends on the year in which you join the school. Since she joined in 6th grade, it was relatively easy for her to make friends since most people were new to the school and the middle division.   

I did not encounter any difficulties while conducting this interview, as they were very cooperative in answering the questions! :)

For our future inquiries, we will generally follow the same protocol as this one, however, we will ask more follow up questions depending on their answers in order to get a deeper understanding on their answer. We had a plan of questions we wanted to ask them, however it could be less rigid next time.
