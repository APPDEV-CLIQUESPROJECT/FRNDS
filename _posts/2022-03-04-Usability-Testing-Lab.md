**Usability Testing Lab Write-Up**

**Task 1: Thriving, Not Just Surviving in School
Task 2: Accessing the Resources of the High School**

We believe our design is the best possible combination of our original designs because it takes the most important and useful aspects from each, and brings them together into a comprehensive idea of how we want our final app to look. We chose Thrive, Not Survive as one of our tasks because it highlights one of the central goals of our app â€“ to help high school figure out how to succeed in school, but also help them to maintain a healthy lifestyle. From our contextual inquiries, we know that school often impedes students' happiness and not knowing the best ways to have success at Horace Mann can make school even more difficult. Accessing the Resources of the High School is our second task because it relates to helping students succeed in school. This task does not just relate to school experience, however, since destressing about school can significantly improve students' mental and physical health. Succeeding in school and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are not mutually exclusive, and in fact, doing one will help students do the other. 

On the top of our design, we have labeled links that can bring people between pages of our app. This design is best suited to the people we are designing for because our users, namely high school students, will prioritize easy use of the app. This website design, with different pages dedicated to different topics, will allow students to easily find whatever resource they want, and the home page will help students figure out what information clicking on each of those subpages will give them. This convenience, along with the ability to easily find which pages will provide which information, makes our design best suited to those we are designing. 

We chose these two tasks because they are most central to the idea of fostering community engagement and to helping the high school community. To foster community engagement, we feel that it is important to not just have a good experience at school, but also to help students maintain a healthy lifestyle. To do this, we have chosen to focus on the tasks that most directly address those two facets of our goal, school experience and lifestyle. Thrive, Not Survive is focused on a healthy lifestyle, though it does incorporate information about how to maintain this lifestyle with school in mind, while Accessing the Resources of the High School focuses on succeeding at school, but also has information about health and wellbeing-related resources in the high school, like the Guidance and Counseling Office, for example.
