Using our affinity diagram and the observations we made during our contextual inquiries, we came up with six tasks that our potential users should be/are doing that relate to our topic: integrating ninth graders into the HM high school community. All tasks are ones that students do to some extent, but we would seek to better accomplish these tasks for more people through our app. The tasks range in difficulty for our app to accomplish depending on time, comfortability, and frequency. Accordingly, they are labeled as easy, medium, or hard, or possibly somewhere between two of those levels. 

**Task 1: Make new friends with old and new students** (Hard)

Student life revolves around friend groups, whether students hang out with friends during frees, lunch, classes, and more. Having friends, especially a good friend group, means that you establish at least a friendly dynamic with a group of people, which can help you meet new people, navigate classes, and support you emotionally. Students coming into the high school, both new and old, have to navigate the new social life, whether it be adjusting to the friend group changes that result from new students coming into the school or just trying to make new friends and find people who have similar interests to you. 
This can be a source of anxiety for incoming high schoolers, and this fear can make it more difficult for students to make friends. The task our app would be trying to accomplish is to help new high school students to navigate the first weeks of high school as they make new friends, possibly lose old ones, and deal with these large changes. We would provide them with advice or help about how to deal with the social chaos of the new environment. 

**Task 2: Learn more about the resources offered in the high school** (Medium)

When students come into the high school, they are generally unaware of the resources the school offers. In the middle school, there is an MD Reading Room, and a homework center, and at other middle schools there are likely similar offerings. Students will often assume that the resources offered by the high school are associated with places, like the resource of the library. However, there are many more resources that are less publicized than, for example, the homework center in the Middle Division, but are equally important. We have a similar homework help program in the high school, though it is never really mentioned at grade meetings or by teachers, like it is in the MD. Furthermore, the people in Guidance and Counseling, as well as those that work in the library, can be helpful resources for classes as well as to discuss emotional and mental health that can be negatively impacted by the transition into high school. In our contextual inquiry, we learned that most people that visit Guidance and Counseling were upperclassmen, suggesting that ninth graders didn’t know much about this department. The task of our app would be to better inform new students about these resources offered by the school and how to access them, something that will be difficult as there can be a stigma surrounding asking for help.

**Task 3: Join extracurriculars** (Easy)

At Horace Mann, we make it very easy to join extracurriculars. There are dozens of clubs, almost all of which are willing to accept anyone that joins. However, many students that are new to HM, or even just new to the Upper Division, don't understand why it is important to join clubs, sports teams, or other extracurriculars. Not only are there benefits like furthering your interests, but it is the opportunity to meet like-minded people that have similar interests. The task that we would be trying to accomplish is to encourage students that are new to HM to join extracurriculars. This task is deceptively difficult: the school already encourages students to join extracurriculars, and promote it with the Clubs Fair, and yet many students still don't choose to follow this advice. When designing our app, we should try to better understand why these students don't follow the advice given by the school and teachers, and how we can push them in the right direction. 

**Task 4: Get adjusted to their classes** (Medium - Hard)

When students come into the high school, the classes and expectations are completely different than they were in the Horace Mann Middle Division or likely were at other middle schools. It can be difficult for students to adjust to this, especially as they try to simultaneously navigate their academic and extracurricular experiences. 

**Task 5: Meet with their teachers** (Easy - Medium)

Teachers often have expectations for students to meet with them no matter how they are doing in their classes, but ninth graders aren’t always aware of this. When a student is struggling, they often know to talk with the teacher, but teachers can appreciate when students check-in without getting a bad grade first. It is important to develop relationships with teachers, so that students trust that teacher and become more comfortable going to meet with that teacher if they are having trouble with the class. It can also be intimidating for ninth graders to email their students and request meetings with teachers, especially if its the beginning of the year and they don’t know their teachers very well. Our task will be to help students get to better know their teachers, and encourage them to set up meetings. 
 
**Task 6: Create healthy sleep and eating habits** (Medium - hard)

It is a well-known fact that Horace Mann students will often sacrifice a healthy lifestyle to get work done. With the heavy tax of hard classes, extracurriculars, friends, and taking some time to relax, many students will often get far too little sleep. The CDC says that teens between the age of 13 and 18 should get between 8 and 10 hours of sleep, while many people that we know will often get as little as 4-5 hours a night. For new students trying to balance the extreme obligations of the high school, as well as getting adjusted to high school life, they will often develop sleep habits that are much worse than those they had in middle school. Furthermore, it isn’t uncommon for students to skip lunch to get work done, sacrificing their mental and physical health for the sake of schoolwork. Our app would have the task of encouraging students, but especially students new to the high school, to develop solid habits that will last throughout high school, and their lifetime.
