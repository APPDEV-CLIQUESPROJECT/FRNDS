# Outline:

**Preliminary Information: Who is in the team, what are their schedules like, any extracurricular commitments requiring extra time, what are everyone’s skill sets, what are people’s general goals with respect to this course and project?**

This team consists of Aanya, Aashna, and Jacob

Free time for outside-of-school meetings:

* Aanya: Any time on Sundays, or weekdays after 6. 
* Jacob: any weekends, weekdays after 6ish, C frees, F every other days, G thursdays
* Aashna: Any time on Sundays

Skill sets:
* Aanya: Primarily Coding
* Aashna: Primarily Designing, But Also Coding
* Jacob: Primarily Designing, But Also Coding

Our goal is to work collaboratively to solve a problem that we need important to the HM Community. In doing this, we hope to improve our skills relating to performing contextual inquiries, improving at user-centered design, furthering our coding and design skills, and learning more about the process of building an app. 

**Guiding Principles: What is the team’s philosophy? What are some ground rules everyone can agree on? What is your mission?**

Creating a respectful and considerate team environment while working dedicatedly and collaboratively towards the end goal. Our mission is to substantively and positively improve the Horace Mann community and benefit the lives of our target audience. We all agree to the principles of basic respectfulness, courtesy, and collaboration: actively listen to others, work to be accommodating to others, follow through on what you tell the group you will do, and try to lift others in the group up, don't put them down, just to name a few. 

**What is the purpose of your project? What is your goal – as you begin your project now, what would you like to have accomplished by the end of this project?**

The purpose of our project is to put forward a useful user-centered app that can be used to facilitate community engagement at HM. Also, we hope to individually improve our design and coding skills, as well as improving at working with others. 

**Group Roles: Can be specifically defined for each person or can be general and open-ended**

We will have fluid group roles, with everyone just working as collaboratively as possible towards the end goal. We recognize that some people are better than others at certain aspects of the app-building process, and we will restrict these strengths when working. 

**Division of Labor: Similar to group roles, but in this section you should specifically outline how the workload will be distributed among the group members.**

The workload will be distributed as equally as possible. If one person is swamped with work, and cannot help out with an interview one day, for example, they might compensate by asking if they can take someone's spot in a contextual inquiry later that week. We will try to hold ourselves accountable and be productive, so as to not put ourselves in a spot where the workload has become unevenly distributed. 

**Team Name: What is your team name and what is the rationale behind it?**

Our name will be FRNDS, also the name of our app. This is because we are trying to encourage people to become friends. However, while this is our goal, it is also more complex than that, and we are trying to help people include and become included. The name emphasizes that people should not just be friends, but something beyond that, captured in our unique name. 

**Team Logo: What will be your project logo and what is the rationale behind it?**

Our logo will be an image of hearts holding hands. We want people to get to know and love each other as people, and we believe our logo, in conjunction with our name, highlights that mission. 

**Team Plan: Write your plan for who will do what as you work on the Group Project Proposal.**

We will collaborate and talk as we work on it, we will brainstorm and combine our ideas, compromising where we don't agree (if that ever happens), we will take into account others' ideas, especially those proposed in Individual Project Proposals. We don't exactly know who will do what, but we will all work together on the Final Proposal of our Idea, and then we can split up, with two people working on the contextual inquiries paragraph and one working on the logo, for example. 

**Meeting Management: How often will you meet? How will you coordinate when to meet? How will you communicate to plan meetings? How will the meetings be conducted, what are your expectations for each group member? How will you support each other so that if someone is having a bad day, the meeting can still be successful? How will you make decisions, what happens if people disagree? How will you manage meeting remotely? How will you manage meeting in person if one or more members are remote?**

We will meet when necessary outside of school, however, we acknowledge most of the work will be done in class, so we will need to be productive there. We will try to all come together for meetings, and we will support each other when others need that. We will try to collaborate and compromise if we disagree, working to solve our disagreements respectfully. 

**Documentation/Accountability: How will you record the pertinent information from a meeting? How will you use each meeting to make an actionable plan for your work and your next meeting? How will you make sure people are held accountable for doing their part?**

If one person is not at a meeting, one of the two people there, or both, should try to take detailed notes on the ideas presented at the meeting. If everyone is there, just looser, more general notes capturing the main ideas and points of the meeting could be useful to later help recall what was discussed and decided upon. We will, again, try to get most of the work done in class, where we can collaborate and divide up work as necessary. Outside of class, we can text about the work to be done and who should do it, as well as scheduling meetings based on the times each person provided earlier in this contract. We believe each person should be responsible for holding themselves accountable for doing their part, but if the other two feel one person is particularly slacking, then those two can talk with that person. 

**Rewards/Punishments: How will you motivate yourselves and each other to do your part and deliver the best possible results? What happens if someone fails to meet their commitments? How is success rewarded? How will you respond to failure to adhere to this product? How will you provide each other with helpful and honest feedback without disrupting the process or hurting the team dynamic?**

We will encourage and motivate each other and try to congratulate each other for our successes. However, we will also try to be open and honest about issues we are having, especially those with each other, like when one person is failing to meet the goals set for them, whether by themselves or by the group. This will provide a supportive and honest dynamic between the group, which will allow us to provide useful feedback to each other without hurting the team dynamic. 

**Follow-Up: How will you check in with each other to make sure this contract is serving the needs of your team and, in turn, that your team is adhering to the contract? How will you revise the contract, should the need arise? How will you make decisions regarding revisions to the contract? What happens if someone on the team has an issue at any point during the process?**

We will regularly check in with each other regarding how our work is progressing, if we are facing any roadblocks, and how to counter them (if there are any). We will plan to do this most classes at least, and outside of class if necessary. If we need to make changes to the contract, we will make sure that everyone agrees to the changes being made in the contract.
