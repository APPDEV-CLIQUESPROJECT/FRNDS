**FRNDS: Helping Horace Mann Students Thrive, Not Survive**

**The Team:**

Aanya - The primary coder of our group. Manages and codes the collective group website and the project website, helps with writing and designing as well. 

Aashna - The primary designer of our group. Takes into account organization and design of the website, helps with writing and coding as well.

Jacob - The primary writer of the group. Specializes in content for testing and mainly writes for the project website, helps with designing as well. 

**Problem:**

The main problem that we identified in our community is that Horace Mann students, especially those new to the high school, lack the resources to thrive in their new environment. Many students get through high school barely surviving, maybe doing fine with their schoolwork but not finding a good work-life balance or maintaining their mental health. We wanted to find a way to help students get through high school in a way that will allow them to succeed in school but also to be healthy and happy. Our website hopes to give students resources and information that they may not know about to inform how to better make it through the high school while balancing all aspects of their lives, especially their emotional and mental health. 

**Contextual Inquiry Review:**

We conducted our first Contextual Inquiry with a freshman who came to Horace Mann in sixth grade. We wanted to gain perspective from somebody who had been at Horace Mann for a while, but was still adjusting to the high school environment. Since the majority of income freshmen come from the middle school, we felt this gave us good insight into how people were dealing with the transition to the Upper Division. 

Our second Contextual Inquiry was with Drs. Westphal, Pervil, and Rothstein from the Guidance and Counseling Office. They have perhaps a better grasp than anyone in the school over the struggles students facing in relation to emotional and mental health. Furthermore, they collectively run the HMO program, which is responsible for helping students adjust to the high school. This made them great resources to understanding how we could best help high school students to succeed in achieving this balance in high school. 

Our third Contextual Inquiry was with a freshman who came to Horace Mann that year. We felt that it was necessary to get this different perspective from someone who wasn't at Horace Mann through middle school, as coming in to the UD from a different school would be an even greater transition, both in terms of work and social life, than coming from the MD. 

Throughout these Contextual Inquiries, we reformed our process to get a better idea of the tasks we wanted our app to accomplish. For the first Inquiry, we simply interviewed the person, asking them questions about their school and social life, along with aspects of their emotional and mental health like their sleep and eating habits. The second Inquiry with the Guidance and Counseling Office made sense to be an interview, but we made sure to make it interactive, asking them about hypothetical scenarios that could mimic a real-life situation. 

**Initial Paper Prototype:**

In our initial prototype, the two tasks we were trying to accomplish were accessing the resources of the high school and thriving, not just surviving in school. Though we made a paper prototype, since it was relatively easy to make a medium-fidelity digital prototype on Figma. Our Figma mirrored the real website in terms of layout and the ability to click between pages, and was really only different in that we did not include all of the text and more intricate details of each web page. This is the prototype we used for our Usability Testing. Our initial prototype did not really accomplish the two tasks, considering that the actual information on the website comes from the text that we didn't incorporate into that design, but we did create the website structure that we would use to accomplish our two tasks. 

**Usability Testing Process and Results:**

In this testing process, we presented test subjects with our initial digital prototype on Figma and told them to just scroll around the website and see what they find. It should be noted that for the first test, there was no text on any of the web pages, but we continued to develop our prototype throughout the process, so there was text during tests two and three. We should also note that our digital prototype was not fully complete, as we didn't have time to make a discussion page for our website on Figma, so we used a paper prototype for that aspect of the website. When users clicked on the "Discussion" tab on the website, we gave them the paper prototype and told them to pretend it was part of the website. In general, the users took this in stride and weren't confused by it. 

Our first test was conducted with a freshman girl who was new to the school this year. A negative incident in his test was that our subject was confused about whether to click the pencil icon or click the create button when trying to make a new discussion post. Our intention was for the user to click the create button, so we decided to remove the pencil icon for the next test.

Our second test was conducted with a junior boy. We conducted this test in the library as an accurate mirror of a possible location in which users might be using our website. This person was able to navigate the website with ease, and the only negative incident was that they had some trouble seeing the text on the website, so we enlarged the text before our final test. 

Our third test was conducted with a freshman boy in our App Dev class. He was able to successfully navigate the website, reaching all the pages and being able to clearly see and read the text on every page. A negative incident, however, was that he was also confused by what to do on the discussion page. While this could have been because using the digital and paper prototypes in conjunction was slightly confusing, we made sure to remember that we should incorporate better indicators on the discussion page when we code it. 

**Final Paper Prototype:**

Since our prototype was already mostly digital, for the next round of testing, we simply incorporated the discussion page into the digital page. Furthermore, using the data we gathered through the Usability Testing process, we made necessary changes to our website to make it more accessible, especially reducing the amount of block text that made the page hard to read, changing the text color to simpler colors, increasing the text size, and laying out each web page more to make it easier to understand. 

The two tasks we aimed to accomplish were thriving, not just surviving through school and accessing resources provided by Horace Mann. The different pages each accomplish different subsections of these two tasks. The resources page tells students about different tools the UD offers to help them succeed in all facets of their life, including socially, emotionally, and mentally. The meetings page talks about why and how to set up meetings with their teachers, which can be extremely beneficial for the student to managing their work and succeeding in that class. The health page talks about sleep, eating, and work in the context of mental health and wellness, and underlines the importance of a healthy work-life balance. The courses page offers information about classes offered in Horace Mann, which is a useful resource to Horace Mann students. 

**Final Testing Results:**

Our final round of testing was a heuristic evaluation in which we received critiques from other members of the App Dev class. This was useful because we had already received data from our Usability Testing and had attempted to implement it into the prototype, and now were able to get information from other designers about potential issues with our website. They are educated in the field of design, and as such, can think from the perspective of potential users, giving extremely useful advice as to how the design could be made more accessible, specific, and easy for users to understand and navigate. In this sense, this heuristic evaluation mirrors real usability testing, but allows us to gather data in a quicker and more concise way. By using this specific UX research method, we were able to crowdsource criticism for our website, getting us more data in a shorter time stretch than we otherwise could have gotten. 

**Discussion and Implementation Plan:**

We had a couple useful takeaways from our heuristic evaluations, especially relating to the design and appearance of the website. We were able to incorporate this advice to make the design even more accessible, making text easier to read, changing colors to make the website easier to understand, and making larger indicators for various aspects of our website. Across the entire project, our vision for the FRNDS website changed drastically. We took into account data from UX research, including the Contextual Inquiries, Usability Testing, and Heuristic Evaluations to try to improve our website and make it as pragmatic and user-friendly as possible.

This entire process has resulted in our creation of a beta version of our final website [Final Website](https://appdev-cliquesproject.github.io/FRNDSOFFICIAL/Courses.html). We were able to set up the general groundwork for our website, but to fully implement the project, would have to spend a lot of time to improve the design of the pages. In the prototype, we were able to more rapidly incorporate feedback from user research, while it was harder to make these changes on our final website. We would need to spend significantly more time working through the code to get the design that we collectively are envisioning. 

To take our website to the next level, we would need to continue the process of iterative design even further. While we received user feedback on our prototypes, to get a final product that is user-friendly and useful, we would need to continue prototyping specific pages and aspects of our website, coding, testing with users, and analyzing how we need to change. Though we didn't have time to reach the point of a publishable website, we learned a lot from this user-based design process. We learned about the process of design, working to create a final project by working to draw up prototypes, conduct user research, and bringing this information into coding, writing, and designing. We learned about the importance of flexibility, adapting our own ideas and vision to what we found worked or didn't work for users. We learned about the importance of collaboration, as it would not have been possible to reach the point we are currently at in the design process without working together.
